 <p class="body">When Fetty was a child, his mother was a singer and would sing at local bars. Fetty's punishment when he was young was to listen to music.

He despised it as a young child. As he grew older his views have changed towards it, and he is now making millions off his own songs.</p>

<h3 class="subtitle">Working with others</h3>

 <p class="body">As he grew to fame in early 2015, many bigger music artists wanted to work with him. In September of 2015 Fetty dropped a song with one 

of the biggest names in music, Drake. Together their song racked in over 100 million views on youtube alone. also in September he worked with the rapper Lil 

Dicky and their song got over 65 million views. Recently in June of 2016 he worked with the up rising all girl group Fifth Harmony, their song is called "flex"

and is currently sitting at about 300 million views.</p>

<h2>Before Fame</h2>

<h3><font color="white">Overview</h3>

<p style="color:white;">Fetty Wap wasn't always rich and famous. He was born Willie Maxwell II. He was born in Patterson, New Jersey on June 7, 1991.
 When he was young he was diagnosed with congential glaucoma in both his eyes. The doctors were only able to save one of his eyes. He wore a prosthetic
 eye until 2014 when he started rising to fame. once in an interview he recalled removing his prothestic eye in the middle of a class in the eigth grade.
 His got his nickname Fetty ( slang for cash ), because he was known for making money. The name Wap came from Gucci Manes alias GuWop.</p>

 <h3><font color="white">Family</h3>

 <p style="color:white;">Fetty has three children, two girls and one boy. His daughters are named Zaviera and Khari Barbie Maxwell, his son is named 
Aydin Maxwell. He had these children with his baby mamma Masika Kalysha, who is a model and a singer. Fetty credited his mother for getting him into
music when he was younger.</p>

<h3><font color="white">Beef with Dice</h3>

<p style="color:white;">"Fetty Wap kicks P-Dice out of the Remy Boyz. The two rappers have different accounts of how it went down.
When Fetty Wap stopped by the office for our "Crew Love: Remy Boyz" profile, he brought along the other two members of the Remy Boyz 
trio, Monty and P-Dice. Right now, "679," currently sitting at No. 5, is Fetty's top song on the Hot 100. The single version of the 
song features Remy Boyz, both Monty and P-Dice. On Fetty Wap's album, though, it's just Monty, as Fetty recently kicked Dice out of 
the crew.In a recent interview with VladTV, Dice explained that Fetty had kicked him out of Remy Boyz in order to avoid a beef with 
Paterson rapper Tax G, who earlier this year, had called out Fetty for jacking his style.</p>

<h2><font color="white">Musical Life</h2>

<h3><font color="white">View on music<h3>

<p>When Fetty was a child, his mother was a singer and would sing at local bars. Fetty's punishment when he was young was to listen to music.
He despised it as a young child. As he grew older his views have changed towards it, and he is now making millions off his own songs.</p>

<h3><font color="white">Working with others</h3>

<p><font color="white">As he grew to fame in early 2015, many bigger music artists wanted to work with him. In September of 2015 Fetty dropped a song with one 
of the biggest names in music, Drake. Together their song racked in over 100 million views on youtube alone. also in September he worked with the rapper Lil 
Dicky and their song got over 65 million views. Recently in June of 2016 he worked with the up rising all girl group Fifth Harmony, their song is called "flex"
and is currently sitting at about 230 million views.</p>

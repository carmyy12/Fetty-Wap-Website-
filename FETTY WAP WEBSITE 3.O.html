<h2>Before Fame</h2>

<h3><font color="white">Overview</h3>

<p style="color:white;">Fetty Wap wasn't always rich and famous. He was born Willie Maxwell II. He was born in Patterson, New Jersey on June 7, 1991.
 When he was young he was diagnosed with congential glaucoma in both his eyes. The doctors were only able to save one of his eyes. He wore a prosthetic
 eye until 2014 when he started rising to fame. once in an interview he recalled removing his prothestic eye in the middle of a class in the eigth grade.
 His got his nickname Fetty ( slang for cash ), because he was known for making money. The name Wap came from Gucci Manes alias GuWop.</p>

 <h3><font color="white">Family</h3>

 <p style="color:white;">Fetty has three children, two girls and one boy. His daughters are named Zaviera and Khari Barbie Maxwell, his son is named 
Aydin Maxwell. He had these children with his baby mamma Masika Kalysha, who is a model and a singer. Fetty credited his mother for getting him into
music when he was younger.</p>

<h3><font color="white">Beef with Dice</h3>

<p style="color:white;">"Fetty Wap kicks P-Dice out of the Remy Boyz. The two rappers have different accounts of how it went down.
When Fetty Wap stopped by the office for our "Crew Love: Remy Boyz" profile, he brought along the other two members of the Remy Boyz 
trio, Monty and P-Dice. Right now, "679," currently sitting at No. 5, is Fetty's top song on the Hot 100. The single version of the 
song features Remy Boyz, both Monty and P-Dice. On Fetty Wap's album, though, it's just Monty, as Fetty recently kicked Dice out of 
the crew.In a recent interview with VladTV, Dice explained that Fetty had kicked him out of Remy Boyz in order to avoid a beef with 
Paterson rapper Tax G, who earlier this year, had called out Fetty for jacking his style. Apparently, though, Tax G's main beef was 
with Dice, and Dice claimed that Tax G told Fetty there would be no conflict if the Remy Boyz let go of Dice. According to Dice, Fetty 
abided. Fetty has since gotten word of Dice's reasoning as to why he was released from the crew, and he has clapped back in an extended 
video response compiled by DJ Akademiks. Throughout the video, Fetty asks, "Where the fuck was Dice," claiming that his former crew member 
only wanted to be a part of the movement after they were playing big-money shows. Fetty also claims that Dice wasn't on the original version 
of "679," the title of which refers to Fetty's birthday (June 7, 1989). Apparently Dice had, behind Fetty's back, decided to remix the "679" 
recording while Fetty was gone in L.A."Dice was never a part of the fucking '679.' Why? Where the fuck was Dice? Nobody fucking knows. We 
called Dice on my birthday, and he didn't show up." He claimed he released the Dice-featuring version of "679" because he wanted to boost 
his friend's career, but he became frustrated when Dice began demanding equal compensation for their performances together, when Fetty Wap 
was the act being booked and not "The Remy Boyz." The final straw, though, according to Fetty, came when Dice had tried to get in between 
Fetty, Monty, and another close friend, Buck, by telling Monty that Buck had slept with his baby mama and telling Buck that Fetty had done 
the same to him. "What real brother, right, hits their brother and say, 'I wonder if you know Buck was fuckin' your baby mother...Then what 
real brother hits Buck and say, 'I wonder do you know Fetty was fuckin' your baby mother?' Wow. You say you wasn't jealous, my n*gga?" 
Fetty then points to the three star tattoos at the top of his forehead and admits that the stars represent Fetty Wap, Monty, and P-Dice. 
"I told n*ggas on the walk through it was gonna be 3 million apiece. Gotta surprise to let you guys know something: I got what I said I was 
gonna get. And now it's only two of us."</p>

<p>When Fetty was a child, his mother was a singer and would sing at local bars. Fetty's punishment when he was young was to listen to music.
He despised it as a young child. As he grew older his views have changed towards it, and he is now making millions off his own songs.</p>

<h3><font color="white">Working with others</h3>

<p><font color="white">As he grew to fame in early 2015, many bigger music artists wanted to work with him. In September of 2015 Fetty dropped a song with one 
of the biggest names in music, Drake. Together their song racked in over 100 million views on youtube alone. also in September he worked with the rapper Lil 
Dicky and their song got over 65 million views. Recently in June of 2016 he worked with the up rising all girl group Fifth Harmony, their song is called "flex"
and is currently sitting at about 230 million views.</p>
